		    <h3>Drones change the war in Ukraine</h3>
		    <p>The war in Ukraine was deadlier in its third year than the first two years combined due to the use of weaponized drones. According to Roman Kostenko, chair of the defense and intelligence committee in Ukraine's Parliament, around 70% of Russian and Ukrainian casualties can be attributed to drones. Both Ukrainian and Russian officials estimate that 3 million to 4 million drones will be made in each country this year. Ukrainian Colonel Vadym Sukharevsky said the country has adopted a "robots first" military strategy.</p>

		    <h3>U.S. Charges Chinese Hackers, Government Officials in Broad Cybercrime Campaign</h3>
		    <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged 12 Chinese nationals in connection with global cybercrime campaigns. In one indictment, eight leaders and employees of alleged private hacking company I-Soon were charged for computer breaches targeting U.S.-based Chinese dissidents, religious organizations, media outlets, a research university, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. In a separate indictment, two Chinese hackers were charged for a purported for-profit hacking campaign targeting U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors, and healthcare systems.</p>

            <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
            <p>Quantum computers leverage the properties of quantum mechanics to process information exponentially faster than classical computers for specific tasks. This year, we're seeing quantum computing being applied in areas such as cryptography, where it can potentially crack currently considered secure codes, and in drug discovery, speeding up the process by accurately simulating molecular structures.</p>

            <h3>Quantum Computing Breakthroughs</h3>
            <p>Quantum computing is moving closer to practical use, with recent breakthroughs in scalability and reliability. Microsoft has unveiled <strong>Majorana 1</strong>, the first Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) powered by a Topological Core, engineered to scale up to a million qubits on a single chip. Alongside, they introduced a hardware-protected topological qubit—small, fast, and digitally controlled—marking a major shift in qubit architecture. A newly published device roadmap outlines the journey toward fault-tolerant quantum computing through quantum error correction. Notably, Microsoft is now on track to build the world’s first fault-tolerant prototype (FTP) quantum computer in collaboration with DARPA’s US2QC program, targeting a reliable, scalable system within years—not decades.</p>

            <h3>Micro LLMs</h3>
            <p>Micro LLMs represent a new direction in natural language processing that focuses on creating compact, efficient versions of large language models without significantly compromising their capabilities. These models are tailored for environments where computational resources, storage or energy consumption is constrained, such as mobile devices, edge computing or real-time applications. The creation of micro LLMs for specific tasks can significantly simplify access to the capabilities of highly developed generative AI, including for medium and small businesses.</p>
